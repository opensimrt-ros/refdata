The ground reaction force csv files are here:

https://springernature.figshare.com/collections/GaitRec_A_large-scale_ground_reaction_force_dataset_of_healthy_and_impaired_gait/4788012/1

you can get them with something like 

wget https://springernature.figshare.com/ndownloader/files/22063185 

but I downloaded it manually. it's easy to create a script to do this (you need to rename the files afterwards), but I won't spend time on this, since it is a one time off thing. 

the dataset with the transitions is the same thing.

you can get it with 

wget https://springernature.figshare.com/ndownloader/files/28998063
