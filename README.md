# Refdata

This version is missing all the data. 

Checkout requirements and extra packages files for dependencies you might be missing. 

For Latex rendering you should install the latest version because Latex is pretty picky with that. See details here: https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html

## TODO: 

- simplify this to just use pfg
- add scripts to download the necessary data
- include the other references which are in another folder!
